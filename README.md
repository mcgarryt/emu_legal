# So You Want Some Good Ol' (mildly illegal) Emulators

----
## Nintendo GameBoy, GameBoy Color, and GameBoy Advance

For the most part, these consoles are taken care of by default functionality in [VisualBoyAdvance](http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gba/vboyadvance.html). However, if you want a more _authentic_ feel to your Nintendo portable gaming experience, [BGB](http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gameboy/bgb.html) is a good alternative for your GB and Color.

## Nintendo DS

For some reason, innovation on the Nintendo DS emulators hasn't happened in a while, so you're going to need to try a variety of the available emulators, and take it on a game-by-game basis. 

[No$GBA](http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gba/nocashgba.html) and [DeSmuME](http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/nds/desmume.html) are going to be your most reliable emulators, but each has its own quirks and set of functions.

## Nintendo 3DS and WiiU

Possibly one of the more involved setup processes are required here. Before you get started, though, [make sure your 3DS game is at least playable](https://citra-emu.org/game/) (rated Great or better). If you're planning on emulating a WiiU, the [compatability guide can be found here](http://compat.cemu.info/).

**WARNING**: at the moment, the WiiU USB Helper patch is broken when you add the 3DS titlekeys. If you want 3DS ROMs right now, it might be best to just download Citra and [toss me an email](mailto:mcgarrynick@gmail.com) if you want a specific ROM.


* Download the [WiiU USB Helper](https://www.reddit.com/r/CemuPiracy/comments/8gj8z8/workaround_download_and_run_wii_u_usb_helper/) following the directions on the Wiki. For simplicity's sake, go with the recommended version and just download the .zip on the GitHub page. Keep track of where you unzipped and launched everything.
* For simplicty's sake, I recommend creating a folder called "3DS" or the like, and extracting everything there. Then, inside that folder, create two folders "DL" and "EX". You'll need these later.
* Run USBHelperLauncher.exe, and follow the instructions precisely. Trust me, no viruses here.
* During setup, when it asks for titlekeys, the 3ds titlekey site you want to enter is [3ds.titlekeys.gq](http://3ds.titlekeys.gq). The WiiU site is [wiiu.titlekeys.gq](wiiu.titlekeys.gq). When it asks where you want to extract and download your ROMs, choose the appropriate DL/EX folder.
* [Download Citra](https://citra-emu.org/download/) and install it to .../DATA/EMULATORS/CITRA. Go with the default settings, for now; you can fiddle with them later. Set your ROM directory to be ../../DL.
* For WiiU: Download [CEMU](http://cemu.info/) and follow the setup there. 
* Everything's all set up now! You should be good. It's a pretty easy system.

## PlayStation

Why should **I** be the one to tell you how to do things? [Follow this guide.](https://fantasyanime.com/emuhelp/epsxe)

## PlayStation 2

[Hey, look, that same dude has a tutorial for PS2 as well!](https://fantasyanime.com/emuhelp/pcsx2)

## PlayStation Portable

PPSSPP has a [quick-and-easy installer](http://ppsspp.org/downloads.html) that you can download! Scroll down to Windows --> Download Installer, and then run the file! Quick and easy setup. There might be some rooting/homebrewing you need to do for it but I haven't used this one personally so YMMV.

##ROMs

There are a variety of places to download ROMs at, but the most reliable right now are [EmuParadise](https://www.emuparadise.me) and [EmulatorZone](http://www.emulator-zone.com), though your mileage may vary on these sites.

For Nintendo 3DS ROMs, please refer to the [Nintendo 3DS](#Nintendo-3DS) section.

PSX ROMs are found [here](http://www.theisozone.com/downloads/playstation/psx-isos/) but make sure that your antivirus is up and running, and you exercise due caution. YMMV. They're also available on [emuparadise](https://www.emuparadise.me/roms/psx/).

PS2 ROMs can be found [on the same site](http://www.theisozone.com/downloads/playstation/ps2-isos/) but the same qualifications apply. They're also found on [emuparadise](https://www.emuparadise.me/Sony_Playstation_2_ISOs/41). 

Honestly, I'd only trust [emuparadise](https://www.emuparadise.me/PSP_ROMs/44) for [PSP ROMs](https://www.emuparadise.me/PSP_ROMs/44), though they are also available on [isozone](http://www.theisozone.com/downloads/playstation/psp-homebrew/).
